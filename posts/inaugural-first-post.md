**The Intro**  
My earliest internet memories were formed during the days when message boards still reigned supreme. I started playing Garry's Mod when it was still a free mod, version 7. I was 13, just figuring out how to install mods after convincing my parents to let me move the family computer to my room. At first, I spent most of my time downloading custom models and skins for the game, but after a while, I spent most of my time browsing the message boards at Facepunch.

A pastime of some of the more zealous users would be to build a website for an off-shoot group of users with a separate interest; I happened to be one of those users. The one problem was I didn't have money for vBulletin, and I had no clue how websites were even made.

**The Basics**  
I don't remember what my learning materials were back in 2005, but I did manage to teach myself the basics of HTML and CSS. The websites I made were not pretty, but 13-year-old me was just ecstatic to get something to render in a browser; At this point, I knew it would take more than just some markup and stylesheets to build something interactive.

**Cue PHP**  
Learning PHP was not easy for me. The learning materials 15 years ago were not the same that you find today. It did exist, but how refined the resources were for a wandering 13-year-old to really grasp, I cannot comment on at this point. If I knew I would one day have the goal of becoming a developer, maybe I would have taken the material more seriously. I don't blame my failure on the literature available to me at the time, but needless to say, I failed to make clone of vBulletin.
