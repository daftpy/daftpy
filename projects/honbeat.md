I created this app over two years ago in **2020**. My main interest at the time was learning a GUI (graphical user interface) library so I could make my applications more interactive. I settled on PyQt5 since the Qt project is widely adopted and well documented.

This was one of my first encounters with event driven programming and quite the paradigm shift from building websites.
